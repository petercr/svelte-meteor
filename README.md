# Welcome to my cool Svelte & Meteor Todo App

**Please note the default `branch` is `main` ‚ù§Ô∏è**

## Sorry this app is not styled yet, but coming soon!

This is is based off of a set of video tutorials by Scott Tolinski of LevelUpTuts on YouTube.
You can find a link to the first video [here on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc4dglMX7fw)

There is no official playlist on his channel for it. ‚òπÔ∏è

This project uses [Svelte](https://www.svelte.dev) as well as [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com).
You can find a copy of [Svelte's MIT license here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/LICENSE), and a copy of [Meteor's MIT license here](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/LICENSE).

This project has it's own MIT license as well, which can be found in the `LICENSE` file.

You need to have Meteor installed on your system in order to run this project. [Instruction for how to do that can be found here](https://www.meteor.com/install).

You will also need a copy of [Node JS & NPM](https://www.nodejs.org) version 10.+ in order to run this project.

## Getting started

Either clone this repository or download the contents from GitHub and place them in a folder.

Then check to make sure Meteor is installed on your system.

```shell
meteor --version

Meteor 1.10.2
```

Then all you have to do is make sure you are in the root directory of the project, and type `meteor` and press `Enter`. Meteor should take care of installing all the packages, and starting up your web server.

```shell
meteor
```

I hope you enjoy this project üëçüèª
